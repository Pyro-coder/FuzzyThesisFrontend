        <h1>Psychopathy Research Survey</h1>
        <p>
            Thank you for assisting with the research study I am completing for my capstone project!  This study is focused on developing a new scoring system for a type of personality assessment.  This is an important project for me that I have devoted a lot of time and effort to, and I am very appreciative of your help.<br>

To begin, please think about the person you would consider to be the biggest troublemaker you know personally - someone who has a history of breaking rules or even laws.  For this study, you will be presented with a series of 20 personality characteristics or behaviors.  You are being asked to rate the "trobulemaker" whom you thought of on each of those dimensions.  You will never be asked to reveal the person's identity, so you can rate that individual honestly and accurately.  I will never know who is being described.<br>

Once you complete the ratings, you are finished.  You will be presented with some statistics and graphs, but that information likely will not mean much to you.  That is ok.  I do not expect you to utilize or understand the output.  That information will be helpful to me as I develop and evaluate the effectiveness of this new scoring system for personality assessment.<br>

If you have additional questions about the study, please feel free to reach out to me.  I would be happy to answer any questions you might have.<br><br>

Once again, thanks so much for helping with my research study!
